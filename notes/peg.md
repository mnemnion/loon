#PEG 

Clua, Lun, and the ported MoonScript should have only one dependency for their compiler, namely the lpeg library. Happily, MoonScript's only dependency is currently lpeg. 

No coincidence, generating PEGs with a rich functional syntax allows for Turing-complete recursive descent parsing, which is, ahem, all you need. More, often. The downside of the approach is that it's work to reuse grammars. One can't simply share them and generate any number of consistent parsing programs using that grammar. 

This functionality is essential to the `<Syntax>` type in Clu, which generates abstract syntax trees from arbitrary data. 

##Things we can make from a grammar

The idea is that by feeding an abstract grammar to the PEGylator, we automatically generate templates for several uses of that grammar. There are a few important ones.

A string validator. This parses the string entirely with matches, returning nothing, retaining nothing, and ultimately rendering a boolean judgement, surrendering all cursory data to the garbage collector. Fast. 

A scanner, which validates a string and provides region information in a vector, without copying anything from the string.

A parser, which creates a consistent type of abstract syntax tree out of the grammar. 

And a table validator, which can take an AST from that parser, and validate the information as something which could have at one time conformed to that grammar. This one is tricky because we allow elision of rule nodes and literal strings, which means we must know when both nodes and leaves can be missing as well as when they must be present. I think we just remove them from the grammar but haven't proven it to my own satisfaction. 

Let's also make a registry, so our error messages can refer to nodes and leaves in their grammar form, not their functionalized Lua equivalent. `expected: form* "#";   got: "^" is how we want an error to read. 

##Types of Table Validation

We have three types of validation for tables. `duck` checks if the minimum attributes are met: if it quacks, swims, and flies, we don't care if it's a flamingo with laryngitis. `bull` also makes sure nothing is missing: if it's a steer, it's not a bull. Which brings us to `steer`, which, if given a bull, cuts the dangly bits off. `steer` does what it can to turn a table into an example of the AST, either deleting or adding nodes as appropriate. `steer` is destructive; the Lua convention is that mutation happens in-place, and you clone your table first if you need the original. 

Since we're using a PEG, `steer` places the first possible literal match at missing positions. This behavior can be overridden on a rule-calling-rule basis. 

##Decorators

I want to add a syntax for overriding the default behavior of a match. Grammars should be purely declarative, so we can generate consistent machines from them. But sometimes we want to use the lpeg tools in a more nuanced way, and in particular we automate the use of `/` to assign functions to the arguments captured. 

## Standard PEG Syntax

We want our PEGs to look familiar. I like Instaparse, personally, and I think a coroutine-based GSS is at least possible. Certainly a fast Rust GLL could be linked and loaded when I get around to writing it. But in the meantime, we wantÂ something like this:

```text

!rule :  concatenated rule          concatenated * rule

!rule : ordered / rule               ordered + rule

!rule : optional* rule ; greedy      optional^0 rule


!rule : at-least-one+ rule            at-least-one^1

!rule : one-or-zero?                  one-or-zero^-1

rule : exactly$2                     exactly * exactly

rule : more-than-two$+2               more-than-two^2

rule : no-more-than-two$-2           no-more-than-two^-2

rule : a-number-between$2..5           a * a * a^-3

!rule : !not-this rule                rule - not-this

!rule : -not-this-period              -not-this-period   

!rule : &if-also-this rule              #if-also-this

rule : [a-b]                            R"ab"        -- customized

rule : {set-rul}                        S"set-rul" -- needs the Unicode treatment
 
!rule : "literal rule"                 P"literal rule"

<hidden rule> : <hidden output>       SUPPRESS "hidden rule"

```
