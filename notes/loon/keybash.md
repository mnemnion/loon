#Keybash

This would be a chance to really warm up my terminal-fu.

Duet needs a keyboard in terminal mode. The way to provide this myself is to write a pop-up keyboard script that makes a mouse-pressable keyboard in the iPad style. But, y'know, terminal widgets.

This is a part of Loon because it's a project I'd want to write in Clu and lets me write libraries for keymapping, which becomes a major league thing later. We use a keymap to assign points to the widgets.

It's the space cadet keyboard all over again!
