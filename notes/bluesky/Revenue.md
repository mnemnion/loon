#Revenue

This much code must be paid for, somehow. 

I am content writing PEGylator, the Clu core, and such auxiliary tools as Lun as a solo, unpaid endeavor. I'm having a great time, and my schedule of work for the year should have enough room while covering expenses. 

Eventually the project will want revenue. Approaches below.

##Selling term

The **term** program should be natively implemented for each of the relevant GUIs. 

The nature of iOS and OSX are such that a signed copy published in the store by the authors would sell and provide reasonable revenue. Sublime seems to do fine with a full-function copy that bugs you to pay for itself, and there's no reason to think an official paid distribution would languish. Quite the opposite I would expect.

Since **term** is basically good for running **bridge** I see no point in selling bridge.

##Bounties/Sponsorships

Mike Pall pays for LuaJIT by proposing and accepting corporate sponsorships. This is a reasonable approach to feature addition in bridge also, I expect.

##Straight Crowdfunding

With Clu written and a fairly compelling demo of **bridge**, it should be plausible to do a one-time crowdfunding campaign to get bridge written by a team of 2-3 developers working on a half to full time basis. 

##Consultancy and Training

The bridge will be a familiar yet novel working environment. While ultimately not a suitable source of revenue for core contributors, consultancy and training on bridge tooling should be good work for aspiring and minor contributors, who can be paid part-time for their work on the core bridge. 

This gets quite extensive, since once the tool gets rolling, the natural tendency is to plug in nginx and start rolling frameworks, CMSes, and the like. This is a good thing for the bottom line, though it happens to be work I'm less interested in.
