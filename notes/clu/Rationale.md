#Rationale

Here you are, in a code repository nurturing what appears to be another programming language. 

[For the love of God, why?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

Short answer: we wish to replace `bash` and `emacs`, while modestly extending the xterm protocol. That's the purpose of Clu, Lun, and the Loon ecosystem generally. They should be a pleasant toolkit to work within, as a result of this design choice. 

`bash` and `emacs` are both programming languages. `bash` is referred to as a 'shell', while `emacs` is an 'editor'. A shell is the exoskeleton of a mollusk, and an editor is a vanishing profession. 

##Bourne Again, again

When I refer to replacing `bash`, I do not mean in the sense in which `zsh` replaces `bash`. I mean in the sense in which the shell replaced batch editing, or the sense in which the GUI has replaced `bash` itself for some less-interesting subset of tasks.
