#Clu

Clu is an idea on the verge of becoming real. 

The [core of the notion](precepts.md) is to expose the Lua runtime through several distinct syntaxes, which interoperate sensibly. Ambitiously, syntax is a first class citizen of Clu: Clu is merely one of the possible [Loon](../Loon.md) syntaxes. The other standard syntaxes are [Lun](../lun.md), a homonym, which is a Lua-like with certain light syntactic changes to harmonize with Loon, and [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org/), which provides CoffeeScript-style whitespace sensitive syntax. MoonScript gets added later; I expect we want to do some light syntax changes to harmonize with the extended Loon libraries. 

Right now we have:

- The [rationale](rationale.md)
- A [grammar](Grammar.md)
- Some discussion of [syntax](syntax.md)
- A bit on the [semantics](semantics.md)
- Some notes on [the compiler](compiling.md)

And a few more miscellaneous ideas I'll link up as they bake down. 


####CLU

Clu (pronounced clue) is not to be confused with [CLU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLU_%28programming_language%29) (pronounced see-el-you, presumably). The latter appears to be safely dead. 

Note further that `.clu` and `.lun` don't appear in this [list of common source code file extensions](http://www.file-extensions.org/filetype/extension/name/source-code-and-script-files), making Clu and Lun good names. The u is pronounced the same in both cases.
