#Lun

Lun is pronounced `lun` in IPA. Americans, you would say "Loon". Please don't call it luhn. You will make me super sad. Think LÅ«n, we will probably stylize in that fashion. 

Clu is one pillar of the Loon environment. The second is Moonscript. The third begins as Lua. We turn it into Lun.

Lun is Lua, empowered by our silly-putty syntax to be useful to our nefarious purposes. 

This justifies our first change, which will make many serious Lua heads happy: The default declaration of a variable is `local`, and the keyword is only needed for forward declaration and shadowing in a local context. Implicit declaration of a variable creates it in the local context, always. MoonScript provides `export`, which is fairly conventional, for globalizing variables. 

Also, it is illegal to declare a local variable within a function argument context, or on the RHS of an expression. If you want to pass a nil, use `nil`. These two changes should remove much of the pain. 

This is absolutely necessary in a command-line scripting language. The global environment must be protected, and the logic the shell will use to persist and maintain aspects of the global environment after executing a script will be moderately complex. Global pollution is bad news in any case, leading to more heartache than the inevitable "where's x? I defined it right there!"

I am tempted to replace `function` with `fn` and use `pub` for global, because I hate typing. But this is Lua; no one learning to program for the first time should have to say "what do 'fun' and 'pub' mean?" and it's practically a sin to increase the semantic load of reading Lua, which generally does what you expect. 

If you want to add a bunch of abbreviations to Luna, or translate all the keywords into Dutch, just change the grammar and write a syntax transform to express the new semantics. The IR will be completely consistent, just target it. Or you can use the macro system, since Lun passes through an IR and can have a reasonably powerful (for an Algol) macro system.

If you like macros, however, I urge you to just use Clu. It's designed for that. 

Changes to Lun will be mild, and will be Lua compatible by definition. That is, Loon will always run Lua if coerced, and any Lun (or Clu, or Moonscript) will interact with ordinary Lua in reasonably consistent ways.

##No impicit chunking (?)

The outer context executes as a series of anonymous function calls. Expression, rather than statement oriented.

This is for better behavior with REPLs, and semantic matching with Clu. Wrapping something in a `do` block chunks it. 

Functions do not implicitly return, but we do parse some things differently: `2 + 3 + 4` on an emptl line calculates and throws away the value. The REPL can catch it. 

The 'outer' context is called the lobby. Without explicit `export` all 'globally' declared variables end up in the lobby, where they are visible to all subsidiary scopes. **lepr** loads in the lobby, rather than in the global environment. 

##Keywords

Lun will adopt `:keyword` syntax for Clu compatibility. This steps on `field:access()`, so we use `field@access`, allowing implicit `@field` references within `self` in functions so defined. This is less implicit than Clu, where `@field` syntax may be used to refer to fields within the first value of any function. 

##Two-way translation

Lun will rewrite your LuaJIT program in Lun. We'll maintain this ability as long as we're able. 

It can of course rewrite Lun as Lua, as this is all it does.
